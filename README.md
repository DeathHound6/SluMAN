## Using on PS3
You need a homebrew-enabled PS3 (either CFW or HEN) and webMAN MOD installed. Additionally you need the ratchetron server VSH plugin installed (this is not currently included with racman EXT)
1. Open RaCMAN EXT, in the dropdown menu select "PS3"
2. Enter your ps3's IP address and click 'connect'. (If you use HEN, make sure it is enabled first.)

Be sure to close racman-EXT before closing the game or turning off your ps3, or crashes/hardlocks may occur.

## Using on RPCS3
1. Open RPCS3 and start the game you want to use.
2. Open RaCMAN EXT, in the dropdown menu select "RPCS3"
3. Click 'connect'

Please note that you'll need to reconnect racman-EXT if you switch games.
